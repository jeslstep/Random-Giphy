# Steps to Deploy on Heroku

## Heroku Prerequisite (one time)
Sign up for an account at https://signup.heroku.com/
You may have to give them a credit card, but you shouldn't need to pay for anything
Install Heroku CLI by typing `brew install heroku` in Terminal
Authenticate by typing heroku login in Terminal
Note: Your project also needs to have a git repository.

## Heroku Setup
1. In terminal, navigate to the project folder and type `heroku create`
2. Login in if prompted
3. Type `git remote -v` to ensure it added successfully
4. Make sure your PORT is configured correctly as: `const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;`


1. Remove the build/ line from your .gitignore 
2. start script in your package.json starts your node server and not React (Heroku won't need to build the React app)
    a. "start": "node server/server.js",
3. Make sure your package.json contains a build script:
    a. "build": "react-scripts build"
4. `npm run build`
5. `git Commit`
6. `git add .` 
7. `git commit -m "YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE"`
8. `git Push`
9. Push to heroku `git push heroku master`

Every time you make a change to the code that you want to see in Heroku: You'll have to make sure you run a build, then commit, then and push to Heroku. Every time.
